# Research-Internship
I completed a 2 month research Internship in the domain of Quantum Mechanics under the "Innovate to Elevate" Program conducted in my College. 

Main project: Plotting the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the Harmonic Oscillator Potential, using the numerical technique of Imaginary Time Evolution, given a Hamiltonian. 

Tech Stack: 
Primary Language: Python
 - Libraries:
    - Scipy.integrate -> solve_ivp
    - matplotlib.pyplot
